# CPSC 513 Project - Verifying the Rope Data Structure of Xi-Editor

This project is using [Dafny](https://rise4fun.com/dafny) to formally verify a standard rope data structure and a very simplified version of the rope data structure used in [xi-editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor).

## Running the Verification

The easiest way to run Dafny programs is to copy and paste the code into the online tool [rise4fun](https://rise4fun.com/dafny)
