There exists a wide variety of text editors.
Some of them, such as Vi~\cite{vi} or Sam~\cite{pike1987text}, rely on older techniques and store text in a buffer that is represented as an array of lines.
Other text editors, such as Atom~\cite{atom} are rich on features and functionality, however, show a lack in performance when processing large files~\cite{atom-perf}.
GTK+~\cite{gtk}, which is a toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces, provides a framework for text editing which uses a rope data structure quite similar to the one used in xi-editor~\cite{gtk-rope}.

There does not seem to be any work related to using formal verification methods for verifying text editor implementations.
In most cases, the implementation correctness is checked by providing a range of unit tests.

Dafny has been used to prove the correctness of distributed systems~\cite{hawblitzel2015ironfleet}, verify operating system implementations~\cite{mai2013verifying} or secure systems~\cite{hawblitzel2014ironclad}.
