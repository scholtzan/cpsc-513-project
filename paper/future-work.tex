Currently, only a few aspects important for text storage in xi-editor have been verified.
Future work could focus on verifying additional parts of xi-editor and reduce simplifications.
For example, it would be useful to also verify that moving through the edit history (eg. undo and redo) is working correctly.
The current implementation also ignores edit deltas and cursors which could be part of future work.

Another aspect that could be investigated is collaborative editing.
Especially situations in which text is edited concurrently by multiple users might result in bugs or inconsistencies.
Since Dafny currently only supports verification of sequential programs, it might be necessary to employ other verification tools or languages, such as TLA+~\cite{chaudhuri2010verifying}.

It would be useful to have something like Dafny which integrates with other programming languages, for example Rust.
Then developers would not need to reimplement their whole system in Dafny for verification.
